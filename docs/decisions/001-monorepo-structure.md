# ADR-001: Turborepo Monorepo with Brand Domain Architecture

**Date**: 2024-12-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Engineering Team  
**Consulted**: Product Team  
**Informed**: All Stakeholders

## Context

PercyTech operates three independent brands (Gnymble, PercyMD, PercyText) that share common functionality but require separate marketing sites and platform applications. We needed to decide on a code organization strategy that would:

- **Maximize code sharing** for common functionality (SMS, customer management, UI components)
- **Maintain brand independence** for marketing and platform customization
- **Enable independent deployments** when necessary
- **Simplify development workflow** with unified tooling and dependencies
- **Support future brand additions** without major restructuring

The team was experiencing development friction with separate repositories for each brand, leading to:

- Duplicated code across brands
- Inconsistent implementations of shared features
- Complex dependency management between shared libraries
- Slower feature development due to cross-repo coordination

## Decision

We will implement a **Turborepo monorepo** with brand-specific applications and shared packages:

```
percytech-monorepo/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                     # Unified Next.js API (all brands)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gnymble-site/           # gnymble.com marketing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ percymd-site/           # percymd.com marketing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ percytext-site/         # percytext.com marketing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gnymble-app/            # app.gnymble.com platform
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ percymd-app/            # app.percymd.com platform
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ percytext-app/          # app.percytext.com platform
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/                  # admin.percytech.com
â””â”€â”€ packages/
    â”œâ”€â”€ shared-ui/              # React components
    â”œâ”€â”€ shared-database/        # Supabase schemas/types
    â”œâ”€â”€ shared-sms/             # SMS logic
    â””â”€â”€ aws-client/             # AWS platform integration
```

**Key Architectural Decisions**:

- **Unified API** serving all brands with brand-aware routing (`/api/[brand]/...`)
- **Separate apps** for each brand's marketing site and platform
- **Shared packages** for common functionality
- **Turborepo** for build orchestration and caching
- **pnpm workspaces** for dependency management

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Code Reuse**: Shared packages eliminate duplication of SMS, database, and UI logic
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types ensure consistency across brands
- **Development Velocity**: Single codebase for shared features accelerates development
- **Unified Tooling**: Single build system, linting, testing, and deployment pipeline
- **Dependency Management**: Single package.json reduces version conflicts
- **Cross-Brand Features**: Easy to implement admin tools and analytics across brands

### Negative Consequences

- **Increased Complexity**: Larger codebase requires more sophisticated tooling and understanding
- **Coupled Deployments**: Changes to shared packages potentially affect all brands
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand monorepo concepts and Turborepo tooling
- **Build Times**: Larger repository may have longer full builds (mitigated by Turborepo caching)

### Neutral Consequences

- **Repository Size**: Single large repo instead of multiple smaller ones
- **CI/CD Changes**: Need to implement path-based triggering for selective builds

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Separate Repositories per Brand

- **Description**: Maintain completely separate codebases for each brand
- **Pros**: Simple deployment, clear ownership, no cross-brand dependencies
- **Cons**: Massive code duplication, inconsistent implementations, complex shared library management

### Alternative 2: Microservices Architecture

- **Description**: Break functionality into separate services (SMS service, customer service, etc.)
- **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity, clear service boundaries
- **Cons**: Network complexity, distributed system challenges, over-engineering for current scale

### Alternative 3: Nx Monorepo

- **Description**: Use Nx instead of Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Pros**: More mature ecosystem, powerful generators, integrated testing
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, more complex configuration, overkill for our use case

### Alternative 4: Rush Monorepo

- **Description**: Microsoft's Rush for monorepo management
- **Pros**: Excellent for large organizations, sophisticated versioning
- **Cons**: Complex setup, designed for much larger scale than needed

## Implementation

### Immediate Actions

1. âœ… **Initialize Turborepo structure** with apps and packages directories
2. âœ… **Configure pnpm workspaces** for dependency management
3. âœ… **Set up Turborepo pipeline** for build, dev, lint, test tasks
4. âœ… **Create shared-database package** with Supabase client and types
5. ðŸ”„ **Create shared-ui package** with React components and brand theming
6. ðŸ”„ **Create shared-sms package** with SMS automation logic

### Long-term Plan

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Core infrastructure and shared packages
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Migrate existing brand applications to monorepo
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Implement unified API with brand routing
- **Phase 4** (Ongoing): Optimize build times and developer experience

### Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity**: 50% reduction in time to implement cross-brand features
- **Code Duplication**: <5% duplication of business logic across brands
- **Build Performance**: <2 minute full monorepo builds
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Team survey showing improved development experience
